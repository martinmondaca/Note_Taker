## Description

The motivation for building this project was the desire to craete a project that uses Express.js, and saves and retrieves information from a JSON file.

The reason for creating this specific project was, so that I could have an application where I could easily write, save, and delete personal notes. 
    
Working on this project I was able to gain more practice using Express.js and further my knowledge in creating GET, POST, and DELETE requests. I was also able to get more practice with deploying a Node.js application to Heroku.
